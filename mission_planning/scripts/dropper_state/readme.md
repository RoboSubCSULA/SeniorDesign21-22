## The dropper state is a state where the AUV grabs onto an object and lifts it up to the surface of the pool

## The AUV may also have to move a lid on the object and drop additional pickup items before ascending to the surface

## After completion of the task, the AUV will determine if it needs to transition over to ping state to listen in to the ping for the torpedo state
